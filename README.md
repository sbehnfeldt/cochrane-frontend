# Instructions

Instructions on how to run the project.

The fact that you are reading these instructions presumes you have either:
a) unzipped the zip file, or:
b) downloaded the source from the git repository
and then changed into the project root directory.
From this point:

1) run "npm i" to install the dependencies (requires node and npm);
2) run "npm start" to start the dev web server;
3) open your browser to the URI specified in the "npm start" command - typically, "http://localhost:3000"

```shell
$> npm i
$> npm start
```
